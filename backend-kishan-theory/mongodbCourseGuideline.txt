Yes! The course I outlined covers all fundamental and most advanced things you need to know in MongoDB for learning, development, and real projects. Let me summarize everything in one clear checklist to make sure nothing is missing:

MongoDB Full Coverage Checklist
1️⃣ Basics

What is MongoDB (NoSQL, JSON-based)

Difference between SQL vs NoSQL

Key features: flexible schema, high performance, replication, sharding

MongoDB structure: Database → Collection → Document

2️⃣ Setup

Local MongoDB installation (mongod, mongo)

MongoDB Atlas (cloud)

Project creation

Cluster creation

Database users

Network access / IP whitelisting

Connect options (Shell, Application, Compass)

3️⃣ CRUD Operations

Create: insertOne, insertMany

Read: find, findOne, filtering, projection

Update: updateOne, updateMany, $set, $inc, $push, $pull

Delete: deleteOne, deleteMany

4️⃣ Data Types

String, Number, Boolean

Array, Object, Date

Null

ObjectId

Example of a document with multiple types

5️⃣ Query Operators

Comparison: $eq, $ne, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $in, $nin

Logical: $and, $or, $not, $nor

Element: $exists, $type

Array: $all, $size, $elemMatch

Evaluation: $regex

6️⃣ Indexing

Single-field index

Compound index

Unique index

Text index

Purpose: improve query performance

7️⃣ Aggregation

$match, $group, $project, $sort, $limit, $skip

Aggregate functions: $sum, $avg, $min, $max, $count

Example: average age, total sales, group by category

8️⃣ Relationships

Embedded documents (one-to-many inside a document)

References (linking documents across collections)

Pros and cons of each approach

9️⃣ Security

Database users

Roles: read, readWrite, dbAdmin, userAdmin

Password management

Network Access / IP whitelisting

TLS/SSL connections

10️⃣ Backup & Restore

Local: mongodump, mongorestore

Atlas automatic backups

Point-in-time restore

11️⃣ Advanced Features

Replication (primary, secondary, arbiter)

Sharding (horizontal scaling)

Transactions (multi-document ACID)

Triggers / Functions (Atlas)

12️⃣ Connection Strings

Format: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>

Options for Node.js, Python, Compass

Environment variables for security

13️⃣ System Databases

admin → global admin tasks

local → internal cluster info

config → sharded cluster configs

14️⃣ Commands Cheat Sheet

Show databases, use database, show collections

CRUD commands

Indexing, aggregation

Connection management

15️⃣ Project Flow

Create Project in Atlas

Create Cluster

Add Database Users

Add Network Access

Connect via application / shell / Compass

Create Databases → Collections → Documents

Perform CRUD / Aggregation / Queries

Backup / Restore

✅ This covers everything from beginner to advanced MongoDB, including all terms, processes, examples, and workflows. After this, you can confidently:

Build full projects like Hospital Management or Ecommerce

Use MongoDB in MERN stack or any backend

Scale your database with sharding and replication

Secure it with users, roles, and IP whitelisting
